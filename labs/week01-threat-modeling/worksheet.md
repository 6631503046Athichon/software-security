# Worksheet 1 — Security Mindset & Threat Modeling (3 hrs)

> **Course:** Software Security (KOSEN69) · **Week 1**
> **Aligned to:** OWASP 2025 A06 Insecure Design · CWE-501 (Trust Boundary Violation)
> **Signature game:** "Elevation of Privilege" (Microsoft STRIDE card deck)

> **Ethics note:** This week is *modeling only* — you analyze design, you do **not** attack the app. Run the sample app only on your own VM/localhost. Never apply these techniques to systems you do not own or lack written permission to test.

## Part 2 — Lecture Questions
Answer in your own words (2–4 sentences each).
1. Define the CIA triad and give one concrete failure example for each of the three properties.
   1.1: Confidentialty = Only authorized users can read it ,failure example Being subjected to a data leak
   1.2: Integrity =  The information must be accurate ,failure example Data hacking and modification
   1.3: Availability = The systems and data must be available ,failure example DDoS attacks are aimed at crashing a server and rendering it unusable

2. What is a *trust boundary*, and why does data crossing one deserve extra scrutiny?
   where data crosses between components of different privilege ， trust：don't know where this information came from

3. Explain "attack surface." Name two things that increase it in a web app.
   Attack surface = every input an attacker can reach ,HTTP ,params , headers, cookies, file uploads, APIs, env vars, dependencies
   example : 1 Committing an environment variable to GitHub ,2 Logging in without authentication

4. What does each STRIDE letter map to, and which security property does each threat violate?
S: Autherntication ，threat : Spoofing ，           T: Integrity        ，threat : Tampering
R: Non-repudiation ，threat : Repudiation，         I： Confidentiality ，threat : Information Disclosure
D: Availability    ， threat : Denial of Service ， E: Authorization    ， threat : Elevation of Privilege

5. What does "Secure by Design" (CISA) mean, and how does it differ from bolting security on after release?
A software and technology development approach that emphasizes security from the design and architecture stages
Secure by Design: Proactive protection, eliminating vulnerabilities from the start

## Part 3 — Hands-on Lab (180 min)
**Learning goals:** build a data-flow diagram (DFD), apply STRIDE to a real Flask app, rank risks, and propose mitigations.
**Prerequisites:** Docker + Docker Compose in your VM; a drawing tool (draw.io / paper + photo); the Elevation of Privilege deck (print or virtual) — free print-and-play PDF at [github.com/adamshostack/eop](https://github.com/adamshostack/eop).

**Environment setup**
```bash
cd labs/week01-threat-modeling
docker compose up --build           # starts sample-app on http://localhost:8080
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/notes -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"owner":"alice","body":"hello"}'   # observe behavior, do not attack
curl -s localhost:8080/notes

echo "demo file" > demo.txt
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/upload -F "file=@demo.txt"   # observe behavior, do not attack
curl -s localhost:8080/files/demo.txt
```

Source to model lives in `sample-app/app.py`. Template to fill: `THREAT-MODEL-TEMPLATE.md` (copy it, do not edit the original).

**What to submit per task:** the threat/element identified + a screenshot (DFD, table, or running app) + a 2–3 sentence mitigation.

**Task 0 — Onboarding (5 min)** · *Goal:* prove the environment works. *Steps:* `docker compose up`, hit `/notes` and `/files/<name>`, read `sample-app/app.py`. *Deliverable:* screenshot of the running app + the JSON response.

**Task 1 — Draw the DFD (25 min)** · *Goal:* map the system. *Steps:* identify the external entity (web client), the process (Flask app), the data store (`notes.db` SQLite), the `uploads/` store, and the flows for `/notes`, `/upload`, `/files/<name>`; mark the Internet→app trust boundary with a dashed line. *Deliverable:* DFD image embedded in your copy of the template.

**Task 2 — STRIDE the elements (30 min)** · *Goal:* enumerate threats per element. *Steps:* for each element fill the S/T/R/I/D/E grid. Ground it in real code: `/notes` accepts a client-supplied `owner` with no auth (Spoofing); `/upload` saves raw `f.filename` — arbitrary-file-write (Tampering) — and echoes the resolved save path back in its response (Information disclosure); `/files/<name>` reads it back but is comparatively defended (see Task 5); no logging anywhere (Repudiation). *Deliverable:* completed STRIDE table.

**Task 3 — Elevation of Privilege game (20 min)** · *Goal:* find threats you missed. *Steps:* play the EoP deck against your DFD; each card you can tie to a real element/flow scores a point; record every valid threat. No printer or scissors? Draw from the digital deck below instead — same 78 cards, same rule. *Deliverable:* list of carded threats + score.

```sim
eop-deck
```

**Task 3b — Systems-level pass (25 min) 🔭** · *Goal:* find what the per-element grid cannot see. Tasks 2 and 3 enumerate threats **one element at a time**, and that is exactly where threat models are known to stop short — students taught STRIDE alone reliably identify component threats and *discount system-level ones* ([Joshi et al., ASEE 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16632)). So do a second pass over the **whole** diagram:
![Three trust zones — public internet, application tier, data tier — with the two boundaries a request crosses between them](img/trust-boundaries.svg)

- **Trust boundaries end-to-end.** Follow one request from the client to `notes.db` and back. List every boundary it crosses. Which crossing has no check on it?
- **Assume one element is fully owned.** Pick the Flask process, then the `uploads/` store. For each: what does the attacker now *reach* — not what is it, but where does it get them?
- **Chain two "low" findings.** Find two threats you or the EoP deck rated minor that combine into something you would not accept. Write the chain as `A → B → consequence`.
- **One-line system claim.** Finish: "Even if every element-level mitigation in Task 8 is implemented, this system still fails if ___."

Use the simulation below before you start — toggle a component to attacker-controlled and watch what it reaches:

```sim
trust-boundary
```

*Deliverable:* the boundary list, two owned-element reachability notes, one written chain, and the system claim.

**Task 4 — Abuse cases & attacker personas (20 min)** · *Goal:* think like specific adversaries. *Steps:* define 2 personas (e.g. a curious logged-in user; an anonymous internet attacker) and write 2 abuse cases each against the sample app, tied to DFD elements. *Deliverable:* 4 abuse cases.

**Task 5 — Path-traversal deep-dive (25 min)** · *Goal:* analyze the riskiest flow. *Steps:* trace `/upload` → `/files/<name>`; explain how `../` in a filename escapes `uploads/`; sketch the secure design (`secure_filename`, store outside web root, allow-list extensions). *Deliverable:* the data flow + secure-design note.

**Task 6 — Threat-model the project target (30 min)** · *Goal:* kick off your term project. *Steps:* stop the sample-app first (`docker compose down` — both apps bind host port 8080), then run **NoteVault** (`cd ../../project/starter-app && docker compose up`), draw a quick DFD, and list the top 3 STRIDE threats you'd investigate. *Deliverable:* NoteVault DFD + top-3 threats (reuse these in your project report — `project/REPORT-TEMPLATE.md` in the repo root).

**Task 7 — Security requirements (15 min)** · *Goal:* turn threats into testable requirements. *Steps:* write 3 security requirements as acceptance criteria ("the system must … so that …"), each mapped to a threat from Task 2 or Task 6. *Deliverable:* 3 testable security requirements.

**Task 8 — Defend / fix it: rank & mitigate (25 min) 🛡️** · *Goal:* turn threats into action you can prove. *Steps:* rank the top 5 threats by likelihood × impact; propose one concrete mitigation each (e.g., auth on `/notes`, `secure_filename()` + allowlist for `/upload`, request logging for Repudiation, size/rate limits for DoS). Then **pick one and actually implement it** in your fork.

![alt text](02.png)

*Deliverable — the top-5 table, plus for the one you implemented:*
1. the **diff** (commit hash on your `wk01` branch),
2. **evidence it works**: the request that succeeded before your change and is refused after — both outputs,
3. **why it closes the class, not the instance** (2–3 sentences). `secure_filename()` on one endpoint is an instance fix; *"no user-supplied string ever becomes a path component"* is a class fix. Say which yours is, and if it's an instance fix, say what the class fix would be.

> **Why this is weighted.** Fewer than half of working developers can spot a security hole in code, and being shown vulnerabilities does not by itself teach you to find or close them. Exploiting is the half that feels like progress; defending is the half that transfers to your job.

## Part 4 — Reflection
1. Map your top finding to a CWE and to OWASP A06 (Insecure Design); explain the mapping in one sentence.
2. Name one real-world breach caused by a design flaw (not a missing patch) and what design control would have prevented it.
3. Of your five mitigations, which gives the most risk reduction per unit of effort, and why?

## Grading rubric (100)
| Criterion | Points |
|---|---|
| Lecture questions (Part 2) | 20 |
| Exploitation + evidence (DFD + STRIDE table + EoP findings + screenshots) | 40 |
| Defense (top-5 ranking + mitigations) | 25 |
| Reflection (CWE/OWASP mapping + breach + best mitigation) | 15 |

**Assessed within the rows above** (they are not extra points — they are what those points are for):
- **Systems-level reasoning** (inside *Exploitation + evidence*, Task 3b): does the model reach past single elements to boundaries, reachability and chains? Scored with the STRIDE + systems-thinking rubrics of [Joshi et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16632).
- **Defensive proof** (inside *Defense*, Task 8): a claimed mitigation with no before/after evidence scores at most half. A mitigation you can show closing a *class* scores full.
- **Adversarial thinking** (across the whole sheet): do the abuse cases, personas and chains show you reasoning as an attacker with goals and constraints — or just listing categories? This is the course's central disposition and it is assessed, not assumed.

## Evidence & Integrity (required)

- **Identity proof:** every screenshot/diagram must show a terminal running `printf '%s | %s | ' "$(whoami)" '<YOUR-STUDENT-ID>'; date '+%F %T %Z'` **in the
  same image as the evidence**. When the evidence is a browser page, a DevTools panel or a
  rendered response, put that terminal **beside the browser and capture the whole screen** — a
  cropped window carries nothing that identifies you, and the lab's own output is
  byte-identical for the whole cohort *by design*, so the stamp is the only thing that makes
  the shot yours. Generic or borrowed evidence is not accepted.
- **Personalized flag (if this lab issues one):** ____________________
  *Flags are unique per student — submitting another student's flag is a violation. How to submit: **learn.zcr.ai/submit** (full guide: `SUBMISSION.md` in the repo root).*
- **Explain in your own words** *(graded on your reasoning, not copied text):*
  1. What did you do, and **why did the vulnerability work**?
  2. **Why does your fix actually stop it** — and what could still break it?

## 🤖 Audit the AI (required)

AI is a power tool you must **distrust** — you are graded on your *critique*, not the AI's answer.

1. Ask an AI assistant to exploit **or** fix this week's vulnerability. Paste its full answer.
2. **Find what's wrong or risky** in it — insecure code, a subtly incomplete fix, a hallucinated API/function/CVE, a missed edge case, or wrong reasoning. Quote the exact line(s).
3. Produce the **correct, verified** version yourself and explain in 2–3 sentences why the AI's output was insufficient.

> Disclose your AI use in the Part 1 table. This task counts toward your **Defense + Reflection** score.

---

## 🧠 Comprehension & Prompt (required)

**A. Explain in Plain English (EiPE).** In 2–3 sentences, in your own words, describe what this week's vulnerable code/endpoint actually *does* and *why it is exploitable* — explain the mechanism, don't dump jargon.

**B. Prompt Problem.** Write a **single prompt** that makes an AI produce a *correct, secure* fix for one finding. Run it: does the exploit now fail? If not, refine the prompt and try again. Submit the **final prompt + the verified result**.
*Graded on the prompt's precision and your verification — this trains problem decomposition and AI literacy (Denny et al. 2024).*
